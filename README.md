# Pixelmon-Allow-Vanilla-Spawns
A Minecraft datapack for the Pixelmon Reforged Mod (1.16.5) that allows for vanilla spawns. This was made for the Pixelmon beta 9.0.9+, any other versions are untested.

To install this datapack you need to open your world, you can either disable the `allow-vanilla-mobs` property in your Pixelmon config (See below), or once you apply kill all pixelmon to remove all of the extra spawned pixelmon by doing the command `/kill @e[type=pixelmon:pixelmon]`

## How To Install
1. Open your world file (normally located `%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/<WORLD_NAME>`
2. Open the `datapacks` folder
3. Put the folder `pixelmon-allow-vanilla-spawns` into the `datapacks` folder (It needs to be inside the pixelmon-allow-vanilla-spawns folder, do not extract the directory should be `%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/<WORLD_NAME>/datapacks/pixelmon-allow-vanilla-spawns`
4. Open the world and type `/datapack enable "file/pixelmon-allow-vanilla-spawns"`
5. Wait for the game to reload completely and it should be applied
